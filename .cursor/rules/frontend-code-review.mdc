# Frontend Code Review Guidelines

## Review Process
- All code must be reviewed by at least one other team member (or AI) before merging.
- Use pull requests for all changes.
- Reviewer must check off the Bug-Prevention & Quality Checklist from .cursorrules.

## What to Check For
- Code clarity, readability, and maintainability
- Correctness and adherence to requirements
- Consistent use of TypeScript types
- Proper use of React/Next.js patterns
- State management best practices (Zustand, TanStack Query, etc.)
- UI consistency and accessibility (a11y)
- Security (XSS, CSRF, etc.)
- Performance (avoid unnecessary re-renders, optimize bundle size)
- Test coverage and meaningful test cases
- No linting or formatting errors

## Best Practices
- Leave constructive, actionable feedback
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are unclear
- Suggest improvements, but respect author's intent
- Approve only when all checklist items and comments are resolved
